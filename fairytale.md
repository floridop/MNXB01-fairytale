# The Squonk: A collaborative story

In a faraway future, in a distant land  
lives the *Squonk*

The average Squonk is 7 meters tall and screams loud.

`Well... your turn now.`

Our *Squonk* is this huge, ex-military biker guy. He is our neighbour who is like 80% handlebar moustache and has a ponytail halfway to his ass. Pretty much human version of Lorax. Our *Squonk* and all of this *Squonk* buddies have tiny dogs and special motorcycle safe seats for them ont heir bikes. 

As was once speculated, the *Squonk* (plural) do more in herds. Like a gang of Hagrids, they all come roaring in on their bikes ant take their tiny dogs out of thier little studded leather safety carriers producing a loud cacophony of kissy sounds and full vlown baby voices like "was that fun sweetie?", "who's my handsome boy?" and "someone please eat my brain spaghetti".
