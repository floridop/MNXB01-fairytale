# The Squonk: A collaborative story
------------------------------------

In a faraway future, in a distant land  
lives the *Squonk*

Many people think Squonks do not exist!
But they do.

Squonks are sometimes considered to be the origin of the word "squanch",
used in the popular television show Rick and Morty.

The average Squonk is 7 meters tall. Due to this, it usually does not
notice when Drowsloks hold marathons and races around its feet.

The Squonk is yellow and covered in scales. It hisses uncontrollably. 
It once met a blue Squonk. He lives in a blue world. He saw the Drowsloks and he hissed at them angrily.

Squonks scream loud. The call of a Squonk can be heard miles away, warning you to stay away. (As most try to live a Squonk-free life, the noise is a mild annoyance at best)

Not that they are dangerous in any way, quite the opposite.

The Squonk is a very friendly and fluffy creature. 
Once you get used to the screaming (which hardly anyone does) you wont be able to stop cuddling your Squonk.

`Well... your turn now.`

Our *Squonk* is this huge, ex-military biker guy. He is our neighbour who is like 80% handlebar moustache and has a ponytail halfway to his ass. Pretty much human version of Lorax. Our *Squonk* and all of this *Squonk* buddies have tiny dogs and special motorcycle safe seats for them ont heir bikes. 

As was once speculated, the *Squonk* (plural) do more in herds. Like a gang of Hagrids, they all come roaring in on their bikes ant take their tiny dogs out of thier little studded leather safety carriers producing a loud cacophony of kissy sounds and full vlown baby voices like "was that fun sweetie?", "who's my handsome boy?" and "someone please eat my brain spaghetti".
